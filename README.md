A collection of AVX-512 accelerated mathematical functions for Rust.

This is very similar to a Rust implementation of the [Intel MKL VM Mathematical Functions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/onemkl-developer-reference-c/top/vector-mathematical-functions/vm-mathematical-functions.html)
